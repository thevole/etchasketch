# Frogger

Frogger is an elm-based implementation of the old standby Frogger game. To build it, you need the following dependencies installed:

* Elm, version 0.17 or greater.

You can build it with:

    ./build

This will generate a target/elm.js file. Once that's been generated, you can visit the index.html file, serving it with any web server, and play the game.

## Development

To run the tests, just run:

    ./test # NOTE: Not yet implemented sorry!

To publish to github pages:

    ./publish
